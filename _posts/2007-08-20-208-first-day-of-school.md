<p>Monday and the first day of school. It was good to meet all my good friends and my classmates again. Looks like they all had i great summer. I know i did. I didn't do much. Only a week trip with our boat. For the rest i have just studied for the drivers test and i have something called "Særemne" nest year. Basically it means i have to read 3 boks of the same author. I finished about 2 of Jo Nesbø's books, Marekorset and Sorgenfri. The last one was ingenious i though. We didn't spend a lot time on the first day of school. I barely had time to great them all. When i took the buss home i traveled with an old friend. We haven't talked in so long so it was very nice to talk again. When i got home i installed uTorrent WebUi. In my opinion uTorrent is one of the best clients, so if you have it would recommend the WebUi. Even though it's only in beta testing it works very well. Basically you can access your client from anywhere in the world and you can interact with it. You also make your own password. The off to work. This time from 17 until 22. Just a normal day. Nothing special happened. Except i got a phone call from Cathrine. She invited me over to her. She is a good friend that just moved into my neighborhood. We tried to build some drawers from Ikea. The first one worked very well. No problems, we were almost a dream team:P But unfortunately the second one we messed up. We thought it was Ikea's fault. But after we got her dad to come help us he solved the problem. Very embarrassing. Now I'm going to sleep. It's almost 1 am. G'Night!</p>

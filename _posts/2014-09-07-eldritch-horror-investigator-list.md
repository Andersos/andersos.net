"It can be arranged. It's just a matter of acceptable terms."

When the press asks if Charlie is planning a run for national office, he smiles and says the he's focused on the important issues. The truth is that he would love to launch his campaign, but right now the most important issue is preventing the end of the world without causing a panic. To do this, he's been calling in favors across the country. Most recently, Charlie's stopped in San Francisco to visit Hearst Castle. With the help of his friends and his finances, Charlie believes he can fix this problem without sacrificing a single vote.

"Leave your fears on the docks, lads. I'll not carry that cargo. The wind is up! Full sail!"

Even as a child in Innsmouth, Silas had a special connection to the sea. He's an able and well-reasoned man on land, but on the ocean he possesses a singular strength and wit. It's earned him a sterling reputation in every port across the globe, particularly in Sidney, where Silas set ashore last night. But this morning, the smell of the briny air carries dread as well as joy. There is something in his past, something in Innsmouth, that he knows will someday catch up to him.

Everyone expected great things from Trish when she was young. In school, she excelled in athletics and the sciences, but she surprised everyone after graduation by settling into a humble position at a commercial code company.

"I will journey to the lands beyond. I do not fear them."

As a young girl in Nigeria, Akachi stayed apart from other children, preferring the company of imaginary friends. Her elders feared madness, but the village dibia believed that she had been chosen by the gods. The wise old man taught her how to travel between worlds and how to marshall spirits. Now, she has become a wise leader herself, traveling across Africa and teaching others to protect themselves. She's recently arrived in Cape Town and from here, she will track down the dark forces that threaten humanity.

Leo Anderson has spent his whole life getting into the deadliest and most obscure corners of the globe. Along the way, he's lost good people. Fever takes some; others are claimed by wild beasts. After a recent, disastrous venture in the Yucatan, Leo barely made it back to Buenos Airies alive. He's sick of burying the people who trusted him. But the job's not done yet.

"Let them call me a crackpot! Something is happening to the stars, and I am not imagining it!"

The scientific community ridiculed Norman for his claim that six stars disappeared from the sky. After exhausting every plausible astronomical explanation for answers, he took a position at the Miskatonic University and began exploring more improbable possibilities in the restricted section of their library. While reading an ancient text of dark prophecies, Norman found an exact description of the phenomenon he'd observed. If the tome is to be believed, a terrible incursion into our world is imminent.

"No, not quiet at all. Dead folks get downright rambunctious when I play my horn."

Old Jim Culver's music gives sweet comfort to the soul, and it doesn't matter if that soul belongs to the living or the dead. Folks in their graves, they love their little chats with Jim. It used to bother him, but now he's happy for the company. Lately, some departed souls in San Antonio have been all riled up about something. They're downright terrified.

"The visions are a warning. The future can be rewritten."

Inside, she found evidence of a terrible cult that had practiced unspeakable rituals there. Jaqueline hopes to use what she's learned to prevent the terrible future to haunts her sleep.

"The Lodge is not as innocent as they pretend. I have learned that nothing is ever as it seems, myself included."

When Diana was initiated into the "Order of the Silver Twilight", she believed it to be nothing more than a community organization. But as she has learned more of its true nature, she has become convinced that a growing evil threatens the world, and that the Silver Twilight will play a role in that threat. She believes her best chance to prevent this is to use her position to sabotage the organization from within. Carl Sanford, the head of the Order, has recognized her skills and recently sent her to Panama for additional training...

<p>I got an sms from my friend Robin saying he was inviting friends over for a poker night on the 10. My dad drow me over to his house at about eight.<br />
When i arrived Robin was watching the end of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/" title="Saw">Saw</a> A god movie. I think the concept behind the Saw movies are ingenious, anyway. Didn't take long before the rest arrived. We started with 100 kr from each. You also had an opportunity to buy-in at a 100 kr, even though nobody did this. We were 7 in total. That meant 525 for the winner, and you guessed it, 175 for 2nd place. We played for almost 2 hours. When i had an Ace and a 10 and "the flop" cam with a 5, 6 and a 10 i had to go all-in. Mostly because i had bad time. I needed to catch the buss. Then Adrian calls me. He was sitting there with a 5 and an 8. The turn comes. Its a queen, than god for me. The wait for the river was intense. If any other card than a 5 or an 8 comes i win. Quess what card comes. A 5. Just my luck! When i went to check what buss to take i realized the last buss lest at about 23.14. But then i wouldn't be home before 1.00 AM. Tragic considering the drive is only 10-15 minutes. But i had luck, i called my dad and he said he could pick me up. That was great. A good day. Next time they said Ivar would host it.</p>

Theme
In a world where there are more opinion makers than fact-makers. How often do you ask ourselves what separates fact from fiction, perception from reality? How do you know that your perception is true? What happens if it don´t? Welcome to TEDxOslo2015-where we`ll challenge your perceptions of the world you live in!

Speakers

Andreas Ekström
Andreas Ekström is an internationally acclaimed journalist and speaker, with a passionate interest for the digital revolution. Still he is not a tech person. He is in it for other reasons: for what happens within society, and to us, as we live through the biggest cultural change in generations. He is author of six books, and a columnist at morning newspaper Sydsvenskan in Malmö, Sweden.

At TEDx in Oslo, his second TEDx experience, Andreas will explore ‘the myth of the unbiased search result’ – and prove that there is no such thing as a ‘clean and objective algorithm’.

What fascinates you about the TED Talks?
”Journalism is about stories. Every given story asks for a shape and form. A TED talk is an excellent form for starting a discussion, and I can’t wait to hear the thoughts, questions and counter arguments that I trust will follow for all of us on the stage in Oslo in January."

Oda Lindholm
Oda Lindholm is an historian, writer and a journalist. She started her carrier as journalist at age of 19, when she created a free magazine called Natt&Dag. At age of 23, she was journalist at Dagavisen, and responsible for the columns about culture, politics and readers’ comments section. At age of 26, she published her first book, «Bullshitfiltert», and has been nominated to a prestigious literary award, the «Brageprisen».
At TEDex Oslo, Oda will address the representation of reality served by the media, and how it affects the perception of reality, especially for the youth.

What fascinates you about the TED Talks?
“I really like the Ted Talks because it is an extremely effective way of getting information out to people, because the talks are very focused and well put together, also because they collect a myriad of different opinions and knowledge, for all areas of the world.”


Mark Eddo
Mark Eddo is a well know presenter and reporter. He regularly hosted 'World Business Report' on BBC World, where he provided BBC reports from Asia, South Africa, the USA, and the Middle East. Until March 2012, he continued to work for the BBC as the roving reporter on ‘BBC World's Africa Business Report’. Mark has also reported for Al Jazeera, CNBC, MSNBC, NBC in San Francisco, and The Wall Street Journal TV in New York.
Mark is a respected public speaker who has moderated many major international business events, such as the United Nations Habitat Conferences in Naples and Kigali, the Economist Magazine Conferences in Abuja, Lagos and Addis Ababa, and the Norwegian African Business Association annual conference in Oslo. Mark is the son of a Nigerian engineer and a British nurse. He grew up in Lagos and London, and at the present lives in Asker, Norway.

What will you talk about at TEDx Oslo event?
Mark's presentation focuses on the perception of Africa derived from media versus the reality as seen from the inside out. He is passionate about Africa, but feels that the continent's progress is in danger of stalling unless the speed of change increases. “One powerful way of increasing the speed is to help people to really understand this fascinating continent.”

What fascinates you about the TED Talks?
"I was one of the first journalists to cover the rise of the dot-coms back in 1990s, when I co-anchored a technology show for MSNBC in San Francisco. As a certified 'geek', I remember the TED talks with fondness. It is amazing how potent their mantra "Ideas worth spreading" has become. Human evolution has hinged on the passing down of information from generation to generation, so TED plays a powerful role in the world as we know it. It's an honor and a privilege to be part of TEDx Oslo 2015 and get the chance to help spread ideas."

Roger Antonsen
Roger Antonsen is a researcher, author, mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. He has a PhD in computer science and mathematics, in the field of mathematical logic and proof theory, and he is the author of the book «Logical Methods: The art of abstract and mathematical thinking» (2014).
Through numerous and creative talks, shows, courses, and projects, he combines science, mathematics, and computer science with entertainment, philosophy, and visualizations. In the last years, he has given hundreds of popular science talks, with titles such as "Logic and Games", "Experimental Mathematics", "Coding, Understanding, and Mathematics", "Playing with the Infinite", "Deterministic Chaos and Cellular Automata", and "30 Mathematical Mysteries in 30 Minutes".
At the present, Roger works at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo as a researcher, lecturer, and science communicator. His vision is to communicate science differently, to inspire creative thinking, and to remove the common misconceptions about mathematics and computer science.

What will you talk about at TEDx Oslo event?
“There are many non-obvious connections between mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, in particular those that has to do with "reality". In this talk, I will try and highlight some of these connections, and talk about what it means to truly understand something, in particular what it means to understand mathematics.”

What fascinates you about the TED Talks?
“TED talks have become a nice forum for talking about ideas. It is fascinating how the talks are able to inspire so many people. The great value of the talks is perhaps that they make you see things in a different perspective.”

Today, Torgeir Waterhouse works as the Director for Internett and New Media at IKT-Norway.

As our societies become increasingly sophisticated the demands for knowledge evolve and change. In 2014 we're sending kids to schools with little or no emphasis on 21 century knowledge. At the same time the people of Norway are busting with knowledge and the classic Norwegian will to make dugnad! Bring on the people powered training for 21 century knowledge: "Teach the kids to code"(Lær Kidsa Koding!)

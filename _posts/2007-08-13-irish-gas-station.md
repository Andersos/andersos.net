<p>I caim over this funny joke and just had to post it! :P Hope you have a laugh!</p>
<p>Taking a wee break from the golf course, Tiger Woods drives his new Mercedes into an Irish gas station.<br />
An  attendant greets him in typical Irish manner, unaware who the golf pro  is...</p>
<p>"Top o' the mornin to ya"<br />
As Tiger gets  out of the car, two tees fall out of his pocket.<br />
"So what are those things, laddie?" asks the attendant.<br />
"They're called tees," replies Tiger.<br />
"And what would ya be usin 'em for, now?" inquires the Irishman.<br />
"Well, they're for resting my balls on  when I drive," replies Tiger.<br />
"Aw, Jaysus, Mary an' Joseph!" exclaims the  Irish attendant.<br />
"Those fellas at Mercedes think  of everything."</p>

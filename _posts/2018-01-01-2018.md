This is part of my yearly Retrospective for 2017.

## Training

My challenge for 2016 was to walk [3,000,000](/2016/04/17/3000000/) steps. In 2016 I ended on 2,568,660 steps only 400,000 steps shy. But in 2017 I finally made it! In 2017 i had a total of [3,???,??? steps](/skritt). Very impressive. 2017 was a great year for excerise as Ill try and summarise below but it really pushed it over the edge when I got my new [sportswatch](link to garmin fenix post) in October 2017.

The next logical step will be to push it all the way to 3,660,000 steps for a goal in 2018. It is a lot harder to go from 8600 per day all the way to 10,000 per day but If I track each month it might be more achiveable.

## Books

Cant really say its been a great year for reading since I only read 3 books this year but I started tracking the articles I read in the end of august and I have so far tracked 865 articles (on avrage 7 articles each day or 216 per month). [My Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/2244364) has a nice overview of the books.

## Movies

Not a lot of movies this year either. most hit files in the cinema. some really old classics and a few repetas like the kings choice and jumanji but I watch it so long ago that it is just now registered. I started to check in movies 01 Oct 2011 and only movies I have seen after that date has been registrered. Any movie I want to register I have to watch again after that date. The only erxception for this was around the 60 first movies I registered the first few days when I started to track the movies. I dont always checkin and rate on IMDB the movie the same day as I see the movie maybe because they dont allow to checkin to the movie on their app or on the web on my phone but mostly it is within a couple of days.

33 movies this years. That is almost 3 each month.

This is a graf of number of movies every month:

http://www.imdb.com/user/ur27912633/checkins?sort=date_added%2Casc&view=detail
I have seen 41 of the 250 top rated IMDB movies this year. The movies in the list changes so we will see how many I have seen next year.

Wish list has grown to 447 movies. I talked about starting at the oldest movies and moving forward but I still struggle to remove movies I really dont want to watch from the list for some reason. Hopefully I am under 400 by the end of 2018.

<p>Today i used most of the day trying to figure out how to send a newsletter. Well it more complicated than it sounds. It's for a local cafe shop. A very down to earth place. It's called "Cafe TID". TID meaning time. They have a saying that's like this: take a break in your life and relax with a cup of coffee. Many coffee houses does this but there is something special with this one. All the clocks in the shop are still. It's just a big pause, anyway, now I'm rambling. I was trying to send the Newsletter, but it got really annoying when i found out that Office can't send HTML coded e-mails. I guess it's because of some security or something. That causes a lot of problems since i have coded a very nice newsletter in HTML. After a couple of hours i finally found a way. I found a shareware that you could edit the source code with. But with this program cam along another problem. When you send a mail with their program there is an add at the bottom of the e-mail. But luckily this was no biggie. I just sent it to my mail and forwarded it to the about 200 contacts.  I'm very proud of that one, even though it was a fairly simple design. I might post it here sometime, but not now.<br />
For dinner we had lamb chops. They were very good. The chef had done an excellent job (If you didn't catch that it was me how made them :P).  Then it was off too work. Working from 5 til 10 at a gas station. Not much to say about it. It's work. But i managed. I just started for a couple of weeks ago. Today a sat a new record. Both breaking even in the registry and being out of the building with the alarm on just 5 past. It can't be done better :D<br />
Then when a cam i have just been surfing the web. After this blog I'm going to watch the first episode of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/" title="Heroes" target="_blank">Heroes</a>. A good friend recomended it and from what i have read it sounds very intresting. Vell wish me good luck :P</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>

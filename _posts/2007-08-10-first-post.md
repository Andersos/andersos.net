<p>Finaly i got my on. My webpage! It was about time! This is my first BLOG entry. I have been wanting to create my own webpage for quite some time and today i grabbed the opportunity and made it. Frankly I didnt have the time. This is hopefully going to be a fun experience, even though i wont always have time to write an article i hope small "snippets" will do the jobb too. In many blogs, ideas don't require an entire article anyway. Blogging seems to make a lot of sense to me and will maybe be a fun spare time activity. Thanks for reading and I hope all my time and effort helps or at least entertains you on many levels.  I will try to write as much as possible. Im going to post funny webpages, usefull webpages, what im doing, and everything else that belongs in a bolg</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>

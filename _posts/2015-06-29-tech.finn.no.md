After @leftieFriele left Finn.no someone had to take over the blog and that someone was me. One of the first things we did was to migrate the blog from a self hosted Wordpress solution over to Jekyll hosted on [Finn's Github](https://github.com/finn-no) account. I have written a little about [why and how](http://tech.finn.no/2015/01/28/from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) on the [tech.finn.no](http://tech.finn.no/) blog.

We want to try and have a more active blog and some of our goals for hte blog is to have x posts and y authors in 2015.

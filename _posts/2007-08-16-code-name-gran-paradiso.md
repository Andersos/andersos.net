<p>Firefox 3 code name Gran Paradison is on the horizon!<br />
It's quite some time until it will be released but more and more details are released each day. Lately Mozilla has released news about their new security system. Mozilla is going to use Google's security system for the new version of the browser. Right now Google are warning their users with a traffic light color system., it's just an advised system so you can continue even though the page is marked red.<br />
This is not the case for Firefox 3.0 says Mozilla's security chief Window Snyder to TechWorld in an interviews. Firefox 3.0 Is going to check every web page that a user wants to access in Google's database. If it's "red"listed there Firefox will explain about this. But the difference here is that you wont get the opportunity to continue. They will totally block sites that are harmful. They do this to make their users safe and help them control whats good and bad. They didn't mention what type of options an administrator will have to override this. Hopefully they will include a way to override this. It's a great idea, and i can se many situations that it would be handy.</p>
<p>The new target release date is sometime in the third quarter this year.</p>
<p>Among the list of mandatory requirements, read, what is the most likely to be included in Firefox 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved interaction with Add-ons: clearer, more coherent language; less steps to install; more visible way to configure add-ons, probably to be moved back to the general Options window</li>
<li>A permanent restart Firefox button.</li>
<li>Support for remote bookmarks, bookmarks and history annotation.</li>
<li>Files could be handled by web services. They are probably referring to Writely or Google Documents, and  perhaps the ability to redirect mailto: links to web email services. That would be sweet, i use hotmail myself.</li>
<li>A much needed print support to prevent cut paragraphs and true WYSIWYG tool (What You See Is What You Get)</li>
<li>The much requested MSI installer which will be a much welcomed improvement for IT administrators as it will ease deployment and updating of Firefox across a company.</li>
<li>In the security front: support for Microsoft CardSpace and OpenID. Smarter credentials handling.</li>
<li><a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2006/09/airbag-to-be-added-to-mozilla-applications/">Airbag</a>, the Google backed open source crash reporting tool will replace currently licensed TalkBack.</li>
<li>A private web browsing mode. I guess this would mean no cache, history, password or entered form information storage.</li>
<li>Save web pages as PDF files, integrated with history. That would be just awesome!!</li>
<li>Support pause/resume downloads across sessions.</li>
<li>Make Firefox help accessible only while online.</li>
<li>Microformats support.</li>
<li>Unified bookmarks/history.</li>
<li>Support for Windows Vista parental controls.</li>
<li>Windows Group Policy.</li>
<li>Allow add-ons to be installed without rebooting Firefox.</li>
<li>Simplified interface to manage downloads.</li>
</ul>

GitHub Pages currently supports several Jekyll plugins:

Jemoji - provides support for emoji within Jekyll posts and pages
Jekyll-mentions - provides support for @mentions within Jekyll posts and pages
Jekyll-redirect-from - redirects visitors to an updated URL when Jekyll post or page filenames change.
Jekyll-sitemap - adds a standards compliant sitemap for your GitHub Pages
In addition, GitHub Pages supports all other functionality of Jekyll, such as native Sass and CoffeeScript support.
